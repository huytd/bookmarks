Dream jobs are a funny thing. You can make money doing what you love. That’s pretty cool. But after multiple interstate, or intercontinental, moves for the sake of finding a new job, or rebooting your social life for the fifth time, or having to explain to your daughter why she’s changing schools and leaving her friends, the cool parts lose their luster.

<blockquote>
<p>
So over the course of this nine part series I want to cover the topics that I think are important in functional programming. I will try to explain first-class and higher-order functions, map and reduce, currying, function composition and monads, lazy evaluation and persistent data structures. All will be illustrated with code examples wherever possible. Most (but not all) of the code will be in Java, Groovy and Clojure because that is what I know best.
</p>

<p>
Topics you will not find in this series include monoids, functors, applicatives, and category theory.

<p>
Their problem:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The main problem with the old server was the unpredictable latency spikes during syncing. The server was written in TypeScript and, being single-threaded, couldn’t process operations in parallel. That meant a single slow operation would lock up the entire worker until it was complete. A common operation is to encode the document and Figma documents can get very large, so operations would take an arbitrarily-long amount of time. Users connected to that worker would be unable to sync their changes in the meantime.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the solution:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
we did by moving the performance-sensitive parts of the multiplayer server into a separate child process. That child process is written in Rust and communicates with its host process using stdin and stdout.

<blockquote>
<p>
Dangling commit: commits that not linked to any commit / branch,.. for most of the times, dropped stashes can be found as a dangling commit.
</p>

<p>
We pipe the output of git fsck thru awk to only log the hashes of the dangling commits.
</p>

<p>
git fsck &#x2013;no-reflogs | awk '<i>dangling commit</i> {print $3}'
</p>

<p>
This still might produce a number of hashes. To better determine which hash corresponds to the commit you dropped from the stash, you can pass the hashes to git log or git show to get more information.
</p>

<p>
When you found the hash, checkout to revert it back.

The Recalbox manager can do other things, too. You can access a variety 
of settings from the Web manager, including wireless network settings 
and shaders. You can even press a button to take a screenshot when 
you're playing games. If you don't like the browser-based manager, 
you can also access
 your Raspberry Pi in Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac, similar to how you'd use a 
network-attached storage device

Debt robs a man of his self-respect, and makes him almost despise himself. Grunting and groaning and working for what he has eaten up or worn out, and now when he is called upon to pay up, he has nothing to show for his money; this is properly termed working for a dead horse.

Engage in one kind of business only, and stick to it faithfully until you succeed, or until your experience shows that you should abandon it. A constant hammering on one nail will generally drive it home at last, so that it can be clinched. When a man's undivided attention is centered on one object, his mind will constantly be suggesting improvements of value, which would escape him if his brain was occupied by a dozen different subjects at once. Many a fortune has slipped through a man's fingers because he was engaged in too many occupations at a time. There is good sense in the old caution against having too many irons in the fire at once.

Imperative thinking became so natural, we see past verbose code. Nonetheless, it requires reading and understanding four lines of code to get to what the code is doing.
The real gain is not having three lines of code less. Very similar problems occur over and over again, sometimes on the same method. If the functional approach is used, every time we'll write less logic, reducing the odds of introducing errors.

You want to know how much your customers are willing to pay for your product, and the only way to do so is to go and talk to them. Most companies use in-product surveys to collect this data.<br><br>However, this model can only be applied after some initial iterations when you have a decent customer base.<br></div><br>You may want to re-apply this strategy often, because your customer base and the market needs keep changing.</div>

<div dir="ltr"><a href="https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/">https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/</a><br><br><b>1. I wish Id had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.<br></b><br>This was the most common regret of all. When people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled. Most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made, or not made.<br><br>It is very important to try and honour at least some of your dreams along the way. From the moment that you lose your health, it is too late. Health brings a freedom very few realise, until they no longer have it.<br><b><br>2. I wish I hadnt worked so hard.</b><br><br>This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their childrens youth and their partners companionship. Women also spoke of this regret. But as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.<br><br>By simplifying your lifestyle and making conscious choices along the way, it is possible to not need the income that you think you do. And by creating more space in your life, you become happier and more open to new opportunities, ones more suited to your new lifestyle.<br><br><b>3. I wish Id had the courage to express my feelings.</b><br><br>Many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others. As a result, they settled for a mediocre existence and never became who they were truly capable of becoming. Many developed illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result.<br><br>We cannot control the reactions of others. However, although people may initially react when you change the way you are by speaking honestly, in the end it raises the relationship to a whole new and healthier level. Either that or it releases the unhealthy relationship from your life. Either way, you win.<br><br><b>4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.</b><br><br>Often they would not truly realise the full benefits of old friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down. Many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the years. There were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved. Everyone misses their friends when they are dying.<br><br>It is common for anyone in a busy lifestyle to let friendships slip. But when you are faced with your approaching death, the physical details of life fall away. People do want to get their financial affairs in order if possible. But it is not money or status that holds the true importance for them. They want to get things in order more for the benefit of those they love. Usually though, they are too ill and weary to ever manage this task. It all comes down to love and relationships in the end. That is all that remains in the final weeks, love and relationships.<br><br><b>5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.</b><br><br>This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice. They had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits. The so-called comfort of familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their physical lives. Fear of change had them pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were content. When deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again.<br><br>When you are on your deathbed, what others think of you is a long way from your mind. How wonderful to be able to let go and smile again, long before you are dying.<br><br><b>Life is a choice. It is YOUR life. </b></div>

After finishing a book, its hard to go through them in order to refine a conclusion and formulate a final statement on the book.<br><br>When going back to a highlighted paragraph, its difficult to understand why exactly this paragraph was important... because the context is hard to capture, using it quickly isnt possible, so you might have to re-read several pages to understand why the highlight was there on the first place.<br><div><br></div><div><b>Benefits of dense notes and summaries</b></div><br>Dense notes (ones which are not directly attached to the book) can serve several purposes. You can keep two sets of notes:<br><ol><li>temporary working notes: will get processed afterwards and mostly kept to make sure you do not miss the important things</li><li>chapter-by-chapter notes: theyre useful both for an immediate recollection (when you just finished the chapter, its still easy for you to recall the details and give an executive summary of the ideas, if the book is nonfiction or happenings if youre reading a fiction book) and for searching for a meaning (in nonfiction) and/or a plot (mostly in fiction books or stories).</li></ol>When youre done with a book, you can go through the two sets of notes, throw away the duplicates, refine wording and ensure the consistency, discard the temporary ones and leave the chapter-by-chapter summaries for the cases when you have to go back to the details of the book.<br><br>Writing a summary after each chapter helps you to capture the ideas before they got wiped out from the memory. Retention is further improved while editing notes and working on the summary.<br><br>After that, you can put together an executive summary, something like a short review for your future self that explains the most important concepts, ideas and, possibly, the meaning of the book. In the end, this is what were looking for.<br><br><b>Making a System</b><br><br>Ive started reading at least a chapter at a time, since it was improving understanding, started getting a feel for the book structure better.<br><br>Having the notes systematised and indexed in electronic format will definitely be helpful if I ever need to go back to these books. If it happens that the notes will be never needed again, I still do not think that the time spent writing them was wasted: I use them as an analytical instrument, not only like an external memory.</div>

This theory, called two-factor theory, or wear-in/wear-out, suggests that repetition has a positive effect for a period, and then begins to have a negative effect.<br><br><div>During the first phase, called wear-in, repetition of an ad allows consumers to become familiar with the brand. In this phase, repetition can overcome consumer reluctance to purchase a new product or brand. As the repetition continues, consumers become used to the brand and may enter a second phase, called wear-out. In the wear-out phase, consumers become tired of hearing about the brand and continued repetition of ads can cause consumers to stop buying the product or brand.</div><div><br></div><div>Consumers tend to pay more attention to an ad that is for a completely 
new product or brand, than to an ad for a product or brand with which 
they are already familiar. The new ad will be more interesting to 
consumers, so they will be more likely to take note of it.</div><div><br></div><div>Repetition of an ad may signal to consumers that the brand or product is a good buy, or a quality product. May convince consumers that the manufacturer is willing to spend a lot 
of money on advertising because the product is a good one.</div></div>
